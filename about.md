Hello! Thanks for checking out my blog. I'm starting a new adventure at [Dev Bootcamp][devbootcamp], and blogging about my experiences. If you have any tips or bugs that you see on this website, please let me know. I'm always looking to imrpove.

These days, I write about life as a millennial, career, productivity, design-thinking and gender. Currently, I live in San Francisco. I've been studying meditation over the past few years, and you can often find me at the San Francisco Zen Center.  I also have a not-so-secret obsession with all things Taylor Swift.

Some background about me: I was born and raised in Andover, MA and I graduated from Duke with a B.S. in high distinction in Economics. At Duke, I wrote my thesis on community development financial institutions (CDFIs) and the use of credit scoring for small business loans. I also also co-authored another thesis on female surname selection choice.

After graduation, I worked at McKinsey & Company, focusing on small business finance, energy and healthcare. I then joined KKR Capstone as a private equity operations executive and spent most of my time on big-data and operations in energy and healthcare companies, working with RigNet, Sunrise Senior Living and National Vision. I also supported our [Environmental, Social and Governance team][kkresg].

Say hi, on [Twitter][coravostwitter]. Or if your're curious about what I'm reading, I tumble blog at [21 Blue Jaguars][bluejaguars].
